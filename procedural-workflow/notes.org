Light source shaders
- Lights may exist alone or be attached to geometric primitives.
-  A light source shader calculates the color of the light emitted from a point on the light source towards a point on the surface being illuminated.
- A light will typically have a color or spectrum, an intensity, a directional dependency and a fall-off with distance.



Surface shaders
    Surface shaders are attached to all geometric primitives and are used to model the optical properties of materials from which the primitive was constructed. A surface shader computes the light reflected in a particular direction by summing over the incoming light and considering the properties of the surface.


Volume shaders
    Volume shaders modulate the color of a light ray as it travels through a volume. Volumes are defined as the insides of solid objects. The atmosphere is the initial volume defined before any objects are created.
