Even lighting
it is best to have as narrow a color range
The biggest challenge when setting up a bluescreen or greenscreen is even lighting and the avoidance of shadow.
A shadow would present itself as a darker color to the camera and might not register for replacement.
Materials which are shiny will be far less successful than those that are not.






Exposure

challenge for bluescreen or greenscreen is proper camera exposure
Onder exposing or over exposing a colored backdrop can lead to poor saturation levels
under exposed images can contain high amounts of noise
In order to get the cleanest key from shooting greenscreen it is necessary to create a value diference between the subject and the greenscreen.
a two-stop diference can be used
Either by making the greenscreen two stops higher than the subject, or vice versa.
