* The Physics
** Newton's Laws of motion
1. An object in motion stays in motion stays in motion and an object in rest stays in rest.
2. F=ma
3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reation.

** Dynamics
Dynamics is the branch of classical mechanics concerned with the study of forces and their effects on motion.
** Types of Dynamics
- Rigid-body Dynamics(p2-js)
- Soft-Body/ Flexible Body Dynamics(Matter-Js, Physics-js)
- Fluid Dynamics
- Multibody Dynamics
- Analytical Dynamics
** Simulation
A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system.

** CGI Simulation
- A CG simulation software provides an approximate physical simulation 
- dynamic elements, such as rigid body dynamics (including collision detection), soft body dynamics, and fluid dynamics
- of use in the domains of computer graphics, video games and film. 
** Physics Libraries
- Bullet Physics
- Havok
- PhysX
- Box2D
- Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit (DART)
- Open Dynamics Engine (ODE)
- Newton Dynamics
** Simulation Software
- Autodesk Maya
- Unreal Engine
- Unity
- Cinema 4D
- SideFx Houdini
** Use in CGI
- objects or particles interact with each other 
-  affected by forces such as wind or gravity
-  traditional animation methods quickly reach their limits
- Animating these elements individually would be a gargantuan task
- This is where simulation is the weapon of choice
** Speed Vs Accuracy

* History of Dynamics and Simulation for Films
** Early use of Physics in CG
- One of the earliest examples of dynamic, multidimensional physics calculations being made in a video game is, of course, Atari's Pong

* Role of Simulation Hardware
As 3D graphics became prevalent in during the 1990s, rendering them in real time began to put a heavy burden on computer processing hardware.
This gradually lead to the introduction of dedicated Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to supplement computers' over-taxed CPUs and take over graphics rendering tasks. 
* Types of cgi Dynamics
* Rigid-body Dynamics
** Definition
In physics, a rigid body  is a solid body in which deformation is zero or so small it can be neglected.

- The distance between any two given points on a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces exerted on it.
- A rigid body is usually considered as a continuous distribution of mass.
